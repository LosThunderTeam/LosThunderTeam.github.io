 <h2 id="hw"> How it works </h2>

 
 <p id="explaination"> With the dedicated controls, each player will be able to naviagate through the various obstacles along the way with the aim to reach the door first. 
Once at the door, the game will establish if the player has collected the set amount of coins before the player is allowed to face the questions. 
The player will face a series of questions which will determine whether a player comes victorious or not.
However, reaching the door first doesn't guarantee victory. This is because the other player will eventually arrive at the door, who also has a set of 
questions to answer. The level is won by the player who answers all thier questions in the fastest time.
This educational aspect of the game is very important because it challenges the players as well as adding the fun element to the game. 
The game also contians a leaderboard section which displays a ranking of top players. </p>

<ol>
<li> <b>Game map </b></li>
<p> The game map was the first key feature developed. This allowed the team to be able to see the first concept of the game and the map layout. This also enabled the 
team to see which element of the map will need to be changed before the full game has been developed. </p>

<li> <b> Game characters </b></li>
<p> The game characters allowed the team to evaluate the main characters of the game.</p>

<li> <b> Quiz Questions </b> </li>

<h3 id="blog"> Version 2 </h3>
<ol>

<li> <b> Additional Levels </b> </li>
<p> As a key element of the game, it was an important aspect which the team had to ensure that it was developed.</p>

<li><b> More Quiz Questions </b></li>
<p> The development of more questions reduces the chances of having repeated questions which ensures that the game is long lasting.</p>

<li><b> Improved Graphics</b></li>
<p> This was a key feature to ensure that the game is attractive. </p>
