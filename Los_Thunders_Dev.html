<h3 id="blog"> Version 1</h3>
<p> This is the first iteration made of the game which included a handful of elements in order to test the game logic and functionality. This version was the starting foundation for the other versions of the game.
The building blocks for this versions were based on the intial requirements such as the game map, first character and quiz questions in order to attract our target auidence.
This also allowed us to be able to build a working prototype which we later build upon.<br><br>
<strong><h4 id="add"> <u>Added:</u> </h4></strong>

<h3 id="blog"> Version 2 </h3>
<p id="info"> This version of the game was particularly more advanced in terms of graphics and the elements within the game itself. 
This version was based on the feedback given which enabled us to craft a game which was more appealing and enjoyable to play.
A few adjustments from the first version were made to help achieve the intended target. These are listed below. </p><br>
<strong><h4 id="add"><u> Added:</u> </h4></strong>
<ul class="elements">
<ol>  - More quiz questions added to each level: (11/2020)</ol>
<ol>  - 2 additional levels: (12/2020)</ol>
<ol>  - Improved Graphics: (12/2020)</ol>
</ul>
<br>
<strong> <h4 id="rmove"> <u>Removed: </u></h4> </strong>
<ul class="elements">
<ol>  - Spikes from the obsticles were removed: (11/2020)</ol>
</ul>
<p> The spikes were removed because it made it particularly difficult for the game characters to manoeuvre through some channels

<h3 id="blog"> Version 3 </h3>
<p id="info"> This version is our most important iteration. This is because we was able to meet all our objectives with the growth of game. 
The version includes new features that enable the game to gain a magical element to it. The first feature that we include that helped achieve this
was the flying <strong class="special"> witch</strong>. Furthermore, we also wanted to include a few more levels, which increased from 3 to 6. 
We limited it to only 6 levels because we felt that we didn't want to make the game feel repetitive and drag out the gameplay.
There are also many other adjustments made to this version which is rather unnoticeable such as the movement of the game island to provide the target auidence a
more impoved experience as before these elements were stretched.</p> <br>
<p id="info"> One special feature that we are proud to announce is the inclusion of a <strong class="special">special power up which is an apple</strong>. This can be seen in the first image below.
This power up allows the user to be able to jump higher to give them an advantage over the other player.</p>
