<h3 id="blog"> Version 1</h3>
<p> This is the first iteration made of the game which consists of a handful of elements in order to test the game logic and functionality. 
  This version was the starting foundation for the other versions of the game. 
  To elaborate, the building blocks for this versions were based on the initial requirements such as the game map, 
  first character and quiz questions in order to attract our target audience. 
  This also allowed us to be able to build a working prototype which we later build upon.<br><br>
<strong><h4 id="add"> <u>Added:</u> </h4></strong>
<ul class="elements">
<ol>  - 1 Game level: (10/2020) </ol>

<ol>  - Game Characters were developed: (10/2020) </ol>
<ol>  - Game Map: 10/2020</ol>
<ol>  - Quiz Questions: (10/2020) </ol>

<h3 id="blog"> Version 2 </h3>
<p id="info"> This version of the game was particularly more advanced in terms of graphics and the elements within the game itself. 
  To hightlight, this version was based on the feedback given which enabled us to craft a game which was more appealing and enjoyable to play.
  A few adjustments from the first version were made to help achieve the intended target. 
  These are listed below. </p><br>
<strong><h4 id="add"><u> Added:</u> </h4></strong>
<ul class="elements">
<ol>  - More quiz questions added to each level: (11/2020)</ol>
<ol>  - 2 additional levels: (12/2020)</ol>
<ol>  - Improved Graphics: (12/2020)</ol>
</ul>
<br>
<strong> <h4 id="rmove"> <u>Removed: </u></h4> </strong>
<ul class="elements">
<ol>  - Spikes from the obstacles were removed: (11/2020)</ol>
</ul>
<p> The spikes were removed because it made it particularly difficult for the game characters to manoeuvre through some channels

<h3 id="blog"> Version 3 </h3>
<p id="info"> This version is was one of the most important iteration, since we were able to meet all our objectives in terms of the growth of game. 
  Moreover, the version includes new features that allows the game to gain a magical element to it, this was achieved by adding flying witches to the background of the game. 
  Furthermore, we also included a few more levels, which increased from three to six. 
  We limited it to only six levels because we felt that we didn't want to make the game feel repetitive and drag out the gameplay, 
  as well as in terms of feasibility in regards to time. There are also many other adjustments that were made to this version which are rather unnoticeable,
  such as the movement of the game island to provide the target audience a more improved experience as before these elements were stretched, making the game difficult to play for our audience.

One special feature that we are proud to announce is the inclusion of a special power up which is an apple. This can be seen in the first image below. This power up allows the user to be able to jump higher to give them an advantage over the other player when avoiding obstacles.</p>
